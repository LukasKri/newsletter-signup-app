## General info

This web site communicates with Mailchimp API (had to remove my API because of security reasons, so please feel free to add yours) and adds new users to the list of subscribers. This is my first real project using an API. I've learned basics about API's endpoints, paths, parameters and authentication. I used Node.js environment and Express.js framework in this project.

## Technologies

-   HTML5
-   CSS3
-   JavaScript
-   Bootstrap v4.6
-   Node.js v15.7.0
-   Express.js v6.14.10

## Setup

All you need is just a web browser and internet access.

## Gained knowledge

-   Node.js and Express.js setup
-   Basic routing and req & res methods in Express.js
-   HTTP requests in Node.js
-   JSON parsing
